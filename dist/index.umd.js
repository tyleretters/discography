When he opened the door, he was struck by the dark-haired girl's beauty, and was especially drawn to her golden necklace. He asked her about its curious fish-shaped design. As she was leaving, she replied: "This is a sign used by the early Christians." Dick called the symbol the "vesicle pisces". This name seems to have been based on his conflation of two related symbols, the Christian ichthys symbol (two intersecting arcs delineating a fish in profile), which the woman was wearing, and the vesica piscis.</p><p>Dick recounted that as the sun glinted off the gold pendant, the reflection caused the generation of a "pink beam" of light that mesmerized him. He came to believe the beam imparted wisdom and clairvoyance, and also believed it to be intelligent. On one occasion, he was startled by a separate recurrence of the pink beam, which imparted the information that his infant son was ill. The Dicks rushed the child to the hospital, where the illness was confirmed by professional diagnosis.</p><p>— Wikipedia, 2024</p><p>The seven movements of this symphonic suite need to be heard in their entirety; it is a mistake to isolate movements from the whole, for the work owes much to the strongly contrasted moods suggested by the character of each planet.</p><p>— The Decca Record Company, Ltd., 1962</p>`,credits:"<p>Thanks to ... a ... tape deck ... original ... everything stalled out ... changed ... that was closer to ... my dad ...

This machine is segmentary because, through its double apparatus of tribe and lineage, it cuts up segments of varying lengths: genealogical filiative units of major, minor, and minimal lineages, with their hierarchy, their respective chiefs, their elders who guard the stocks and organize marriages; territorial tribal units of primary, secondary, and tertiary sections, also having their dominant roles and their alliances. "The point of separation between the tribal sections becomes the point of divergence in the clan structure of the lineages associated with each section. For, as we have seen, clans and their lineages are not distinct corporate groups, but are embodied in local communities, through which they function structurally." The two systems intersect, each segment being associated with the flows and the chains, with the stocked flows and the passing flows, with selections from the flows and detachments from the chains (certain production projects are executed in the framework of the tribal system, others in the framework of the lineage system). The variability and relativity of the segments are responsible for all sorts of penetrations between the inalienable elements of filiation and the mobile elements of alliance. This is explained by the fact that the length of each segment—or even its existence as such—is determined only by its opposition to other segments in a series of interrelated stages. The segmentary machine mixes rivalries, conflicts, and ruptures throughout the variations of filiation and the fluctuations of alliance. The whole system evolves between two poles: that of fusion through opposition to other groups, and that of scission through the constant formation of new lineages aspiring to independence, with capitalization of alliances and filiation. From one pole to the other, all the misfirings and failures in a system that is constantly reborn of its own disharmonies. What does Jeanne Favret mean when she shows, along with other ethnologists, that "the persistence of a segmentary organization requires paradoxically that its mechanisms be ineffectual enough so that fear remains the motor of the whole"? And what is this fear? It would appear that social formations experienced a morbid and mournful foreboding of things to come, although what comes to them always comes from without, rushing in through their opening. Perhaps it is even for this reason that it arrives from without; they suffocate its inner potentiality, at the cost of the dysfunctions that constitute an integral part of the functioning of their system.</p><p>— Deleuze & Guattari, 1972</p>',credits:"<p>Thanks to the person who sold me a faulty tape deck so I could not continue this project as intended because the original tape deck was in an airplane hanger because of the pandemic and everything stalled out for so long on both sides of the incident and then the project changed — like everything else did, that was closer to then and things are different now.

His world is hardened, Metal Gear, long drag of cigarette, pushing limits of body to transport mind. Licking his wounds, drinking warm Modelo, watching cargo ships queue up for port, he contemplates getting out of the game for good.</p><p>But when money runs out (like it always does) he's forced to accept an impossible gig: US/APAC. The cargo is a Tiresias figure, some aged clairvoyant who, having struck their staff at two copulating serpents, was then blinded, given the gift of prophecy (visions), and transformed into a woman for seven years.</p><p>Who seeks a strange country by illegal means that can only place them perpetually outside while also inside? Coyote knows: someone who has a message... or someone who is one. What is the message now? What does Tiresias only know while blind and femme?</p><p>Coyote's reference gear attempts to help his line of thought with encyclopedic minutiae: "Like with other oracles, how Tiresias obtained their information varied: sometimes, they would receive visions; other times they would listen for the songs of birds, or ask for a description of visions and pictures appearing within the smoke of burnt offerings or entrails, and so interpret them. Pliny the Elder credits Tiresias with the invention of augury. Tiresias has a daughter, Manto, who is also a prophetess and priestess."</p><p>Simple machine that cannot breathe or ache. Coyote dictates futile corrections to his gear. This Oracle of Zones is a mother, alright. The twin Zones - both Special Economic and Temporary Autonomous - symbolize invitations by their respective hosts to become changed; to be shown wrong. High on artificial fumes in virtual caves, Tiresias (pregnant with Manto?) are illegal yet invited; necessary; load-bearing. She sees and listens, assembles, then tells. And she's coming now, changing Self to change the flow of things, money, talk, data. She dies but goes on.

In the same vein, nomadic science keeps infiltrating royal science, undermining its axioms and principles. Nomadology is a speedy, pocket-sized treatise that refuses to be pinned down.

The growing block theory, maybe the most intuitive of the three, states that the present continually creates the past, but the future is unwritten. Presentism on the other hand argues that the only thing irrefutable is the present and that the past and the future are both unreal. By applying these three concepts to music, we may end up with a number of strategies to rethink what we consider as given.</p><p>I would like to propose that there has been has been a slow shift in how music was perceived. Improvised music, prior to notation, can be considered as presentistic, manifesting itself only in the present, it’s only traces of existence written in memory. With interpretation and notation, the perception shifts more to a growing block. The mind got a hold of the past, but the future still remained a very unstable realm - once the hand made a mistake with an instrument or the voice was interrupted to catch a breath. Obviously the advent of the recording introduced an absolute future and with it the concept of eternalism in music. Furthermore the introduction of the loop, applied in its most extreme way within techno, embeds the listener in a coherent body of past and future, even with a view of the timeline - first on the record, later on the waveform. A car, racing on the Autobahn, free to move in both directions. Of course, one could argue that the state of ecstasy in which techno is consumed compresses time into a perfect present, the psychological present, which is defined as 2-3 seconds with the equivalent of 1 bar by 120 bpm…</p><p>But staying for the moment with the first thought, we can ask the questions: is the loop the defining property of techno? What happens if we remove the certainty of the next kick, eroding the temporal and structural integrity of the genre? Presentism is a project based on one temporal randomised pulse, denying our ability to foresee the next kick and obscuring the possibility to form loops. Yet it upholds timbres and instrument references common to the genre. The aleatoric function acts like an agent of presentism in an eternalist domain. Like improvisation, it has the ability to remove a stable future and at the same time blur the memory by forming insignificant patterns. Intensification usually benefits from a balance between control and the prospect of collapse. The temporal shuffle of techno is the attempted surrender of control of the past and future to the present.</p><p>— JAT, 2020</p>",credits:`<p>Thanks to the person who sold me a faulty tape deck so I could not continue this project as intended because the original tape deck was in an airplane hanger because of the pandemic and everything stalled out for so long on both sides of the incident and then the project changed — like everything else did, that was closer to then and things are different now.

Some of this was good but had found itself in a “stuck” state. Some things extended a bit earlier than the boundary of acquaintance but felt appropriate for inclusion. At any rate, both humans were in an exorcising mood. They decided it was time to release these peach fuzz laden demons. The exorcism exercise would be comprised of a continuous sort of mix tape or DJ mix containing these demons occupying the auditory plane.</p><p>As is becoming their custom, the humans again took turns weaving the structures. This time the structures were on a somewhat larger scale. They pulled in beats, basslines, melodies, and scraps of texture. Both humans expected the final product to be quite rhythmic and beat-driven. To their credit, this does appear to accurately describe much of what the three of us arrived at. They did manage to sneak in some free-meter synth jams, which provided some loose [a]rhythmic accompaniment to the more musically adherent elements.</p><p>However, the real surprise came when the emotional impact of exorcising some demons in particular started to affect both humans. The beats in these instances decidedly needed to take a back seat to the so-called “feels”: drones, sad arpeggio breakdowns, lolling refracted feedback melodies. As the iris of psychic transmorgification closed, the minds’ eyes adjusted back to the new light level, the steam evaporated, the dust settled, and the humans incanted an old, familiar phrase to lighten these heaviest of demons:</p><p>... like tears in the rain ...</p><p>The final mix arrived at a total of 300 MB worth of uncompressed PCM audio. This size is above Bandcamp’s 291MB track limit, so 9MB was cut down from the final waveform data.

At different times, the power supply of either enclosure failed in identical fashion. The second time, the steward of the enclosure discovered that the power supply had, in fact, not completely failed. It could still deliver some power, albeit at an attenuated amperage. Perhaps as a test, perhaps enthused at the novelty of the small enclosure, perhaps simply to amuse himself, he assembled a nonsensical menagerie of modules.</p><p>The human then proceeded to record similarly nonsensical sounds. He doubted they were musical. They did contain rhythms, tones, things that repeat, but no more than household or industrial appliances. No logic or aesthetics he knew of applied. They were low-fidelity but not enough to be charming. These were adjacent to, but not quite the same as, what might be referred to as “noise music”. At times something resembling a melody or a chord would appear, but short-lived and unsupported. He didn't know what to do with this, but he was having fun, so he forged ahead.</p><p>After indulging a compulsion to record, the first human decided to share a few minutes of this with the second human. The second human was not sure what to make of this. Out of mutual respect, he attempted to phrase a diplomatic and critically constructive suggestion. He introduced this suggestion. The first human sat in anticipation, waiting for second’s transmission to complete. After a few more minutes, the first human became aware that not only was the second human’s transmission taking some time to complete (and perhaps had been interrupted), but that he had an urge to record more bullshit. And so he did.</p><p>By the time the first human had another recording to share, the second human had completed his transmission, and in fact had a record of his own to share. It was a collage, a juxtaposition: the original recording with new layers. The first human was shocked and delighted. This was beginning to sound like music.

Specifically, the task force was to research the use of long-time warning messages to prevent future access to the planned, but stalled, deep geological nuclear repository project of Yucca Mountain.</p><p>PROBLEM</p><p>When atomic or fusion bombs are detonated in a war, or nuclear power plants are used in times of peace, an unnaturally high amount of radioactive waste is produced. This material will threaten human life and health for thousands of years. Consequently, nuclear technology necessitates the creation of a secure means of terminal storage for such materials for an unusually long time period.</p><p>However, there is no method available to continuously provide the necessary knowledge about the location of nuclear waste over thousands of years. The culture of earlier centuries becomes incomprehensible when it is not translated into new languages every few generations. National institutions do not exist longer than a few hundred years. Even religions are not older than a few millennia and do not typically hand down scientific knowledge.</p><p>Furthermore, the necessary length of storage is disputed among specialists. One work group in Germany concluded that nuclear waste must be separated from the biosphere up to one million years — about 30,000 human generations. Earlier assumptions were based on a period of 10,000 years, which seems to be too short given the half-life of certain radioactive isotopes (e.g. Plutonium-239 at 24,000 years).</p><p>The written historical tradition of humanity, in contrast, is only about 5,000 years. Warnings in cuneiform script could be interpreted by some specialists, but others, such as the writing of the Indus Valley civilization, are already illegible after a few thousand years.</p><p>REQUIREMENTS</p><p>Three parts of any communication about nuclear waste must be conveyed to posterity:</p><p>1. that it is a message at all</p><p>2. that dangerous material is stored in a given location</p><p>3. information about the type of dangerous substances</p><p>ANSWERS</p><p>To determine how to convey these three things, the "Zeitschrift für Semiotik" (Tübingen, Germany) issued a poll in 1982 and 1983 asking how a message might be communicated for a duration of 10,000 years. The poll asked the following question: "How would it be possible to inform our descendants for the next 10,000 years about the storage locations and dangers of radioactive waste?" leading to the following answers...</p>',credits:"<p>The musician would like to express his deepest thanks to @license for their critical ear and honest heart.</p>",project_slug:"stuxnet",release_slug:"human-interference-task-force",cover_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/human-interference-task-force/human-interference-task-force.jpg",mp3_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/human-interference-task-force/human-interference-task-force-mp3.zip",wav_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/human-interference-task-force/human-interference-task-force-wav.zip",id:"70d383f39cd6c320f14ae8f8112ab125"},{title:"COUNTERSURVEILLANCE",project:"STUXNET",released:"02021-07-07",type:"EP",format:"Digital",role:"Operator",label:"Intertext",mp3:!0,wav:!0,tracks:[{number:1,title:"Dazzle Camouflage (MUA)",length:"00:05:16",mp3_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/countersurveillance/01-dazzle-camouflage-mua.mp3",wav_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/countersurveillance/01-dazzle-camouflage-mua.wav",id:"b3e55e82d01163b32e55719915098c3a"},{number:2,title:"Countersurveillance",length:"00:04:09",mp3_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/countersurveillance/02-countersurveillance.mp3",wav_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/countersurveillance/02-countersurveillance.wav",id:"6dc975e67926eeec29161acbf020d1e6"},{number:3,title:"A Territory of History, Without Self",length:"00:03:33",mp3_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/countersurveillance/03-a-territory-of-history-without-self.mp3",wav_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/countersurveillance/03-a-territory-of-history-without-self.wav",id:"443d85726b3da2bbcf3f1e73cb75247c"},{number:4,title:"Pyrocumulus Days, Entropy Nights",length:"00:02:18",mp3_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/countersurveillance/04-pyrocumulus-days-entropy-nights.mp3",wav_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/countersurveillance/04-pyrocumulus-days-entropy-nights.wav",id:"2bbf6bb6019421586f7c422490fb877f"},{number:5,title:"What's Your Wifi Password?",length:"00:02:18",mp3_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/countersurveillance/05-whats-your-wifi-password.mp3",wav_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/countersurveillance/05-whats-your-wifi-password.wav",id:"2bcbc1e1c036d5aececc7994b3c16ea8"},{number:6,title:"I'm On Blockchain",length:"00:03:02",mp3_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/countersurveillance/06-im-on-blockchain.mp3",wav_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/countersurveillance/06-im-on-blockchain.wav",id:"f28af783b6bf7c71feaf8681bd925b6a"},{number:7,title:"Maybe",length:"00:04:35",mp3_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/countersurveillance/07-maybe.mp3",wav_url:"https://d107e1o0dn11sc.cloudfront.net/stuxnet/countersurveillance/07-maybe.wav",id:"d9b1078aadc31f8feb907ca5aa3e74bd"}],notes:"<p>Mapcore is a viable solution for surveying the world.</p>",credits:'<p>COUNTERINTELLIGENCE was written, recorded, designed, and released on the STUXNET: NIGHTLY STREAMS // UNREMEMBERED DREAMS Twitch channel.

recently came across the following rules of communication, posted in a School of Journalism:</p><p>1. Know your audience and address yourself directly to it.</p><p>2. Know what you want to say and say it clearly and fully.</p><p>3. Reach the maximum audience by utilizing existing channels.</p><p>Whatever sense this may have made in a world of print, it makes no sense today. In fact, the reverse of each rule applies.</p><p>If you address yourself to an audience, you accept at the outset basic premises that unite the audience. You put on the audience, repeating clichés familiar to it. But artists don't address themselves to audiences; they create audiences. The artist talks to themself out loud. If what they say is significant, others hear and are affected.</p><p>The trouble with knowing what to say and saying it clearly and fully is that clear speaking is generally obsolete thinking. Clear statement is like an art object: it is the afterlife of the process which called it into being. The process itself is the significant step and, especially at the beginning, is often incomplete & uncertain. Columbus's maps were vague & sketchy, but showed the right continent.</p><p>The problem with full statement is that it doesn't involve: it leaves no room for participation; it's addressed to consumer, not co-producer. Allan Kaprow posted a few small posters about Berkeley: "SUPPOSE you were interested in designing a primer, in mixed media, etc. . . . Allan Kaprow will be in Berkeley in July & August." No phone, address, dates, terms. He found, however, that those who wanted to work with him, and those he wanted to work with, located him without difficulty.</p><p>Reaching the maximum audience may be the last thing one wants to achieve. George Segal says, "I don't give myself to everybody. I give myself very intensely to my work, my wife, my kids, my few friends. I can't begin to give myself indiscriminately to all. It's the only thing that makes me pause about, say, Ginsberg's preachings of universal love or even California ideas about Esalen and touching."</p><p>Utilizing existing channels can wipe out a statement. There is a widely accepted misconception that media merely serve as neutral packages for the dissemination of raw facts. Photographers once thought that by getting their photographs published in Life, they would thereby reach large audiences. Gradually they discovered that the only message that came through was Life magazine itself and that their pictures had become but bits and pieces of that message. Unwittingly they contributed to a message far removed from the one they intended.</p><p>The same thing occurs on TV guest shows. Guests accept invitations to appear on programs in the hopes their messages will reach new and wider audiences, but even when they are treated in a friendly manner, they generally come away with a sense of failure. Somehow the message transmitted is far removed from the message intended. The original message has been declassified by an alien medium. "Oh, what a blow that phantom gave me!" cries Don Quixote.</p><p>The young today shun the hardware of the past. Marx thought the big question was: Who owns the presses? Software makes hardware obsolete, an encumbrance, creating a false sense of power and security. The young package their messages in media that fit their messages, that is, they create new media to fit their messages. In so doing, they create their own audiences. Some of these audiences may be very small at the beginning. In Houston I met film makers producing films for audiences of no more than six. The point was that they would reach the right people in the right way with the right message.</p><p>It is one of the curiosities of a new medium, a new format, that at the moment it first appears, it's never valued, but it is believed.
